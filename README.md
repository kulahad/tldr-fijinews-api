# News - Webscraping
Its quite interesting to see how easy it is to automate a lot of the things that we do in our daily web routine.
Oh well, my idea is to automate a service which would scrape data from some of the local news platforms and display it collectively via an API.That would mean that it could be consumed by any type of app - be it mobile or desktop.
